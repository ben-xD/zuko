Dear [parent/carer's name]
I am writing to inform you of my decision to suspend [child's name] for a fixed period of [specify period].  This means that [child's name] will not be allowed in school for this period.  The suspension [begins/began] on [date] and ends on [date].
I realise that this suspension may well be upsetting for you and your family, but the decision to suspend [child's name] has not been taken lightly.  [Child's name] has been suspended for this fixed period because [reason for suspension].
We will set work for [name of child] to be completed [during the first five school days/for the period] of this suspension.  Please ensure that work set by the school is completed and returned to us promptly for marking [detail the arrangements for this]. 
You have a duty to ensure that your child is not found in a public place during [the first five school days of this suspension] i.e. [specify dates] unless there is reasonable justification for this.  I must warn you that you may be prosecuted or receive a penalty notice from the local authority, if your child is found in a public place during normal school hours, on the specified dates, without reasonable justification.
[Paragraph for use if this suspension is for more than five consecutive days - secondary age pupil] 
From the sixth school day of [pupil name]’s suspension [specify date] until the expiry of the suspension [specify date] we will provide suitable full-time education.  I have today informed the Ormiston Academies Trust (OAT) of [pupil name]’s suspension and they will contact you directly about the arrangements for [pupil name]’s education from the sixth day of suspension.
[Primary schools suspending pupils for more than five days must make arrangements with a local/neighbouring school to receive the pupil and outline the details and contact person at the receiving school]
As this suspension will result in [pupil’s name] missing a [public examination/ national curriculum test] the governing board must meet to consider whether the suspended pupil should be reinstated.  At the review meeting you may make representations to the governing board if you wish.  The latest date on which the governing board can meet is [date here — no later than 15 school days from the date the governing board is notified], however as far as is reasonably practicable to do so, the meeting will take place before the date of the examination or test. If it is not practicable for a sufficient number of governors to consider the decision before the examination or test, [in the case of a maintained school] the chair of governors may consider the pupil’s reinstatement alone and decide whether or not to reinstate the pupil [in the case of an academy] the suspension may be considered by a committee of the trust board, including a local governing body [if the trust’s articles of association allow them to do so]. 
If you wish to make representations to the governing board and wish to be accompanied by a friend or representative, please contact [name of contact] on/at [contact details — address, telephone number, email], as soon as possible.  [Pupil’s name] is also able to attend and participate in the meeting if you feel it is appropriate for them to do so.  
You will, whether you choose to make representations or not, be notified by the clerk to the governing board of the time, date and location of the meeting.  Please advise if you have a disability or special needs which would affect your ability to attend a meeting at the school.  Also, please inform [contact] if it would be helpful for you to have an interpreter present at the meeting.
You have the right to make a request to hold the meeting via the use of remote access. Please inform [contact] if this is your preference when making your request for a meeting. You are advised to consider the following, before requesting a remote access meeting:
• The technology that will be used for the governing board meeting
• Do you have an appropriate space free from other distractions to enable you to participate fully with a remote access meeting?
• If you have limited access to the Internet, intermittent service, or slower speed Internet, you should not request a remote meeting.
• If you initially ask for a meeting to be held via the use of remote access then decide to withdraw the request, you should inform the governing board without delay. The governing board should without delay, arrange the meeting to be held face to face.
If you think this suspension has occurred as a result of discrimination then you may also make a claim under the Equality Act 2010 to the First Tier Tribunal (Special Education Needs and Disability) in the case of disability discrimination, or the County Court, in the case of other forms of discrimination.  Making a claim would not affect your right to make representations to the governing board
