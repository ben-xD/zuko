School Suspension Policy

1. Purpose
This policy outlines the procedures for suspending a pupil from school due to violations of the school's code of conduct. The goal of suspension is to maintain a safe and respectful learning environment while providing the pupil an opportunity to reflect on their behavior and make positive changes.

2. Grounds for Suspension
A pupil may be suspended for serious breaches of the school’s rules, including but not limited to:

Physical violence or threats of harm toward students or staff
Bullying, harassment, or discrimination
Possession of prohibited substances or dangerous items
Vandalism or theft
Persistent disruptive behavior despite previous warnings
3. Suspension Duration
Suspensions may be issued for a period of 1 to 10 school days, depending on the severity of the offense. In rare cases involving ongoing investigations or repeated misconduct, a suspension may be extended up to 15 days.

4. Communication and Notice
The headteacher will inform the pupil’s parents or guardians in writing about the suspension, including:

The reason(s) for suspension
The duration of the suspension
The pupil’s expected return date
A meeting invitation to discuss the situation, if necessary
5. Pupil Support
During the suspension, the school will offer appropriate support to the pupil, including access to school counselors, behavioral programs, or educational resources to prevent learning loss. If needed, the school may develop an individualized behavior improvement plan for the pupil.

6. Reintegration
Upon returning to school, the pupil will attend a reintegration meeting with their parents, the headteacher, and other relevant staff to discuss expectations for future behavior. The school may set additional conditions, such as regular check-ins with a counselor or completion of a reflection assignment.

7. Appeal Process
Parents or guardians may appeal a suspension by submitting a written request to the headteacher within 5 school days of receiving the suspension notice. The school’s governing body will review the appeal and provide a written decision within 10 school days.

8. Record-Keeping
A formal record of the suspension, including all related communications and actions, will be maintained in the pupil’s file for reference in future disciplinary proceedings or appeals.

9. Policy Review
This policy will be reviewed annually by the school’s governing body to ensure it meets current educational and legal standards.
